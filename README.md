#Decrypt0r

Decrypt0r is a utility which help you to decrypt all the iOS firmware components. <br>

###Rootfs decrypting

To decrypt rootfs or other components you have to get keys from https://www.theiphonewiki.com/wiki/Firmware_Keys. <br>

You have to enter the IPSW filename (ex : iPhone5,4_8.4.1_12H321_Restore.ipsw). <br>
The program will ask you to add the keys grabed from iphonewiki (only one for the rootfs). <br>

Then, the tool will decompress you'll have to add the rootgs name <br>
Next you have specify the name of the file containing rootfs (ex 058-24465-023.dmg). <br>
In the IPSW file, there is three dmg files, that of rootfs is heaviest. <br>

Then the program is going to work automaticaly. <br>

If you want to modify rootfs (ex Setup.app -ASR will not accept the feat without BootROM firmware) you can use TransMac. <br>

### Encryption of rootfs and creating a Custom fimware

You can now create your own Custom fimware. <br>
Downgrades are already impossible without SHSHs blobs, on devices that do not have low level exploits. <br>
Is this fonction useless ? <br>
Yes, but it can still be used. <br>

#Other components

To decrypt other firmware components like kernelcache or iBoot, you have to grab the keys from theiphonewiki <br>
The first one to add is the largest, and the second one is the iv key (the smallest) <br>

## TODO

- Add a version for GNU/Linux and OS X <br>
- Clean my code <br>
